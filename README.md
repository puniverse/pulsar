# Pulsar: lightweight threads and Erlang-like actors for Clojure

**NOTE: This is alpha software**

Pulsar wraps the [Quasar](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar) library with a Clojure API that's very similar to Erlang.

## Requirements

Java 7 and Clojure 1.5 are required to run Pulsar.

## Getting started

Getting started with Pulsar is a bit clunky at this stage because of its dependency on jsr166e.

1. Install [lein-localrepo](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-localrepo) by adding
    `{:user {:plugins [[lein-localrepo "0.4.1"]]}}` to your `~/.lein/profiles.clj` file.
2. Donwload jsr166e by clicking [here](http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/jsr166/dist/jsr166e.jar).
3. Deploy the jsr166e to the local maven repository with this command:
    ```
    lein localrepo install jsr166e.jar jsr166e/jsr166e 0.1
    ```
4. Finally, add the following dependency to [Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/)'s project.clj:

    ```clojure
    [co.paralleluniverse/pulsar "0.1.0"]
    ```

Then, the following must be added to the `java` command line or to project.clj's `:jvm-opts`
section:

```
-javaagent:path-to-quasar-jar.jar
```

Alternatively, to build Pulsar from the source, clone the repository and run:

```
lein uberjar
lein test
```

## Usage

Currently, there isn’t much in the way of documentation (coming soon!).
In the meantime, you can study the examples [here](https://github.com/puniverse/pulsar/tree/master/src/test/clojure/co/paralleluniverse/pulsar_test/examples)
and the tests [here](https://github.com/puniverse/pulsar/blob/master/src/test/clojure/co/paralleluniverse/pulsar_test.clj).

You can also read the introductory [blog post(http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/post/49445260575/quasar-pulsar).

When running code that uses Pulsar, the instrumentation agent must be run by adding the following
to the `java` command line
or to the `:jvm-opts` section in project.clj:

```
-javaagent:path-to-quasar-jar.jar
```
